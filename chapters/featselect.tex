\chapter{Feature Selection}\label{ch:featselect}

We know from \cref{ch:esmodels} there exists linear weights $\vec{w}$ for 
\cref{eq:CDR:feat} found with evolutionary optimisation that achieve a lower 
\namerho, than any of the aforementioned preference models have been able to 
learn. This goes to show that the $d=\NrFeatLocal$ features are `enough' -- 
meaning there is not a need for defining new ones just yet. 
However, the optimal weights for \cref{eq:cma:objfun} were quite erratic (cf. 
\cref{fig:cma:wei}). 
Perhaps the features from $\Phi^{\CMAES}$ are 
contradictory, and therefore not suitable for preference learning. 
Furthermore, the SDRs we've inspected so-far are based on two job-attributes 
from \cref{tbl:features}, namely
\begin{enumerate*}[after={{,}}]
  \item \phiproc\ for SPT and LPT 
  \item \phijobWrm\ for LWR and MWR 
\end{enumerate*}
by choosing the lowest value for SPT and LWR, and highest value for LPT and 
MWR, i.e., the extremal values for those attributes. 
These SDRs achieve a remarkably low $\rho$, so perhaps not that many additional 
features are needed to achieve a competitive result.

For this study we will consider all combinations of 
feature attributes using either one, two, three or all $d=\NrFeatLocal$ of 
them, for a total of
\begin{equation}
{d \choose 1}+{d \choose 2}+{d \choose 3}+{d \choose d} = 697
\end{equation}
The reason for such a limiting number of active features, are due to the fact 
we want to keep the models simple enough for improved model interpretability.

For each feature combination, a linear preference model is created, where 
$\Psi_p$ is limited to the predetermined feature combination. 
This was done for all \Problem[10\times10]{\train} in \cref{tbl:data} (save for 
job and machine variation), 
each consisting of $N_{\train}=300$ problem instances.
Moreover, in order to report the validation accuracy, 20\% 
(i.e. $N_{\text{val}}=60$) of the training set was set aside for 
reporting the accuracy.

\subsection{Validation accuracy}\label{sec:CDR:acc}
As the preference set $\Psi_p$ has both preference pairs belonging to optimal
ranking, and subsequent rankings, it is not of primary importance to classify
\emph{all} rankings correctly, just the optimal ones. Therefore, instead of
reporting the validation accuracy based on the classification problem of the
correctly labelling the entire problem set $\Psi_p$, it's opted that the 
validation accuracy is obtained using \cref{eq:tracc:opt}, namely the 
probability of choosing an optimal decision given the resulting linear 
weights.\footnote{Due to the superabundant number of models then calculating 
    the \emph{preferable} $\xi_{\pi}$ from \cref{eq:tracc:track} is not viable.}
However, in this context, the mean throughout the dispatching process is
reported, i.e., 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:meanstepwiseopt}
\overline{\xi^{\star}_{\pi}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K \xi^{\star}_{\pi}(k)
\end{equation}
\Cref{fig:stepwise_vs_classification} shows the difference between
the two measures of reporting validation accuracy. 

Validation accuracy based on \cref{eq:meanstepwiseopt} only takes into 
consideration the likelihood of choosing the optimal move at each time step. 
However, the classification accuracy is also trying to correctly distinguish 
all subsequent rankings in addition of choosing the optimal move, as expected 
that measure is considerably lower.

    learning}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Pareto front}\label{sec:CDR:pareto}
When training the learning model one wants to keep the validation accuracy 
high, as that would imply a higher likelihood of making optimal decisions, 
which would in turn translate into a low final makespan. To test the validity 
of this assumptions, each of the 697 models is run on the preference set, and 
its mean $\rho$ is reported against its corresponding validation accuracy 
\cref{eq:meanstepwiseopt} in \cref{fig:CDR:scatter}. 
The models are colour-coded w.r.t. the number of active features, and a line is 
drawn through its Pareto front. 
Those solutions are labelled with their corresponding model ID. 
Moreover, the Pareto front over all 697 models, irrespective of active feature 
count, is denoted with triangles. 
Their values are reported in \cref{tbl:CDR:pareto}, where the best objective is 
given in boldface. 

\begin{table}[p]
  \caption{Mean validation accuracy and mean expected deviation from 
    optimality, $\rho$, for all CDR models on the Pareto front from 
    \cref{fig:CDR:scatter}.}\label{tbl:CDR:pareto}
  \input{tables/PREF-equal}
\end{table}

\Cref{fig:CDR:weights} depicts $\vec{w}$ for all of the learned CDR models 
reported in \cref{tbl:CDR:pareto}. 
The weights have been normalised for clarity purposes, such that it is scaled 
to $\norm{\vec{w}}=1$, thereby giving each feature their proportional 
contribution to the preference $I_j^{\pi}$ defined by \cref{eq:CDR}. 
These weights will now be explored further, along with testing whether models 
are statistically significant to one another, using a 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with $\alpha=0.05$.

For \jrnd{10}{10}  there is no statistical difference between models (2.69, 
3.355, 3.358, 3.524), w.r.t. $\rho$ and the latter three w.r.t. 
accuracy. These models are therefore equivalently `best' for the problem space.
As \cref{fig:CDR:weights} shows, \phiendTime, \phijobWrm\ and \phimacWrm\ are 
similar in value, and in the case of 3.358, then \phimacFree\ has similar 
contribution as \phiendTime\ for the other models. 
Which, as standalone models are 1.6 and 1.3, respectively, and yield 
equivalent mean $\rho$ and accuracy.
As these features often coincide in \jsp\, it is justifiable to use only 
either one, as the it contains the same information as its 
counterpart.\footnote{Note, \phiendTime$~\leq~$\phimacFree, where
  \phiendTime$~=~$\phimacFree\ when $J_j$ is the latest job on $M_a$, 
  otherwise $J_j$ is placed in a previously created slot on $M_a$.}
Most likely, the equivalence of these features is indicating that the 
schedules are rarely able to dispatch in earlier slots, i.e., 
\phiendTime$~\approx~$\phimacFree. 

In addition, (2.111, 3.300) and (16.1, 3.355) are statistically insignificant 
w.r.t. validation accuracy for \jrnd{10}{10}. However, they have considerable 
performance difference w.r.t. $\rho$ ($\Delta\rho \approx 18\%$). 
So even looking at stepwise optimality, $\xi_{\pi}^{\star}$ by itself is very 
fickle, because slight variations can be quite dramatic to the end result. 

The solutions on the Pareto front for \jrndn{10}{10} are quite a few models
with no (or minimal) statistical difference w.r.t. $\rho$, and 
considerably more w.r.t. validation accuracy. 
Most notably are (3.281, 2.73, 2.75, 1.13)
(note, first one has the lowest mean $\rho$), which are all statistically 
insignificant w.r.t. validation accuracy yet none w.r.t. $\rho$, with 
difference up to $\Delta\rho=6.32\%$.

For \frnd{10}{10} almost all models are statistically different w.r.t. $\rho$, 
only exception is (1.6, 1.7).
Although, w.r.t. validation accuracy, there are a few equivalent models, 
namely, (3.151, 2.51), (2.94, 1.6) and (3.216, 3.213, 16.1), with $1.2\%$, 
$2.3\%$ and $5.75\%$ difference in mean $\rho$, respectively. 

It's interesting to inspect the full model for \frnd{10}{10}, 16.1. 
Despite having similar contributions, yet statistically significantly 
different, as all the active features as (3.213, 3.216), then the (slight) 
interference from of other features, hinders the full model from achieving a 
low $\rho$. 
Only considering \phijobOps\ and \phimacOps\ with either \phiendTime\ and 
\phimacFree, boosts performance by 5.28\% and 5.72\%, respectively. 
Thereby stressing the importance of feature selection, to steer clear of 
over-fitting. Note, unlike \jrnd{10}{10}, now \phiendTime\ differs from 
\phimacFree, indicating that there are some slots created, which could be 
better utilised.
Moreover, looking at model 2.111 for \frnd{10}{10}, which has similar 
contributions as the best model, 3.539. Then introducing a third feature, 
\phimacWrm, is the key to the success of the CDR, with a boost of $\rho$ 
performance by 1.33\%. 

Note, for both \jrnd{10}{10} and \jrndn{10}{10}, model 1.13 is on the Pareto 
front. The model corresponds to feature \phijobWrm, and in both cases has a 
weight strictly greater than zero (cf. \cref{fig:CDR:weights}). Revisiting 
\cref{eq:CDR:SDR}, we observe that this implies the learning 
model was able to discover MWR as one of the Pareto solutions, and as is 
expected, there is no statistical difference to between 1.13 and MWR.

As one can see from \cref{fig:CDR:scatter}, adding additional features to 
express the linear model boosts performance in both validation accuracy and 
expected mean for $\rho$, i.e., the Pareto fronts are cascading towards more 
desirable outcome with higher number  of active features. However, there is a 
cut-off point for such improvement, as using all features is generally 
considerably worse off due to overfitting of classifying the preference set.

    accuracy and minimum mean expected $\rho$ (\%), and labelled with their

\end{figure}

Now, let's inspect the models corresponding to the minimum mean $\rho$ and 
highest mean validation accuracy, highlighted in \cref{tbl:CDR:pareto} and 
inspect the stepwise optimality for those models in \cref{fig:CDR:opt}, again 
using probability of randomly guessing an optimal move (i.e. 
$\xi^{\star}_{\RND}$ from \cref{fig:diff:opt:rnd}) as a benchmark.
As one can see for both \jrnd{10}{10} and \jrndn{10}{10}, despite having a 
higher mean validation accuracy overall, the probabilities vary significantly. 
A lower mean $\rho$ is obtained when the validation accuracy is gradually 
increasing over time, and especially during the last phase of the 
scheduling.\footnote{It's almost illegible to notice this shift directly 
  from \cref{fig:CDR:opt}, as the difference between the two best models is 
  oscillating up to only 3\% at any given step. In fact \jrndn{10}{10} has 
  the most clear difference w.r.t. classification accuracy of indicating when 
  a minimum $\rho$ model excels at choosing the preferred move.} 
Revisiting \cref{fig:case}, this trend indicates that it's likelier for the 
resulting makespan to be considerably worse off if suboptimal moves are made at 
later stages, than at earlier stages. Therefore, it's imperative to make the 
`best' decision at the `right' moment, not just look at the overall mean 
performance. 
Hence, the measure of validation accuracy as discussed in \cref{sec:CDR:acc} 
should take into consideration the impact a suboptimal move yields on a 
step-by-step basis, e.g., \cref{eq:tracc:opt} is weighted w.r.t. a curve such 
as \cref{eq:bwc:opt}.

    highest mean validation accuracy (grey) and lowest mean deviation from 
    optimality, $\rho$, (black) compared to the baseline of probability of 
    choosing an optimal move at random (dashed).}
  \label{fig:CDR:opt}
\end{figure}

Let's revert back to the original SDRs discussed in \cref{sec:opt:sdr} and 
compare the best CDR models, a box-plot for $\rho$ is depicted in 
\cref{fig:boxplot:CDR}. Firstly, there is a statistical difference between all 
models, and  clearly the CDR model corresponding to minimum mean $\rho$ value, 
is the clear winner, and outperforms the  SDRs substantially. However, the best 
model w.r.t. maximum validation accuracy, then the CDR model shows a lacklustre 
performance. In some cases it's better off, e.g., compared to LWR, yet for 
\jsp\ it doesn't surpass the performance of MWR. This implies, the learning 
model is over-fitting the training data. Results hold for the test set.

\subsection{Conclusions}

When training the learning model, it's not sufficient to only optimize w.r.t. 
highest mean validation accuracy. As \cref{sec:CDR:pareto} showed, there is a 
trade-off between making the over-all best decisions versus making the right 
decision on crucial time points in the scheduling process, as \cref{fig:case} 
clearly illustrated. It is for this reason, traditional feature selection such 
as add1 and drop1 were unsuccessful in preliminary experiments, and thus 
resorting to having to exhaustively search all feature combinations.
This also opens of the question of how should validation accuracy be measured? 
Since the model is based on learning preferences, both based on optimal versus 
suboptimal, and then varying degrees of suboptimality. As we are only looking 
at the ranks in a black and white fashion, such that the makespans need to be 
strictly greater to belong to a higher rank, then it can be argued that some 
ranks should be grouped together if their makespans are sufficiently close. 
This would simplify the training set, making it (presumably) less of 
contradictions and more appropriate for linear learning. Or simply the 
validation accuracy could be weighted w.r.t. the  difference in 
makespan.
During the dispatching process, there are some pivotal times which need to be 
especially taken care off. \Cref{fig:case} showed how making suboptimal 
decisions were more of a factor during the later stages, whereas for flow-shop 
the case was exact opposite. \todo[inline]{Could discuss new sampling 
  strategies, e.g., proportional to best/worst case, optimality, etc. -- have 
  done some experiments, but not clear what strategy is best, so only equal 
  probability reported}

Despite the abundance of information gathered by following an optimal 
trajectory, the knowledge obtained is not enough by itself. Since the learning 
model isn't perfect, it is bound to make a mistake eventually. When it does, 
the model is in uncharted  territory as there is not certainty the samples 
already collected are able to explain the current situation. For this we 
propose investigating features from suboptimal trajectories as well, since the 
future observations depend on previous predictions. 
A straight forward approach would be to inspect 
the trajectories of promising SDRs or CDRs. 
In fact, it would be worth while to try out imitation learning by 
\cite{RossB10,RossGB11}, such that the learned policy following an optimal 
trajectory is used to collect training data, and the learned model is updated. 
This can be done over several iterations, with the benefit being, that the 
states that are likely to occur in practice are investigated, and as such used 
to dissuade the model from making poor choices. Alas, this comes at great 
computational cost due to the substantial amounts of states that need to be 
optimised for their correct labelling. Making it only practical for \jsp\ of 
a considerable lower dimension. 

Although this study has been structured around the \jsp\ scheduling problem, 
it is easily extended to other types of deterministic optimisation problems 
that involve sequential decision making. 
The framework presented here collects snap-shots of the state space by 
following an optimal trajectory, and verifying the resulting optimal makespan 
from each possible state. 
From which the stepwise optimality of individual features can be inspected, 
which could for instance justify omittance in feature selection. 
\todo[color=pink]{Not done, but possible} 
Moreover, by looking at the best and worst case scenario of suboptimal 
dispatches, it is possible to pinpoint vulnerable times in the scheduling 
process.
