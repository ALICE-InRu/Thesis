When using a feature space based on SDRs, the linear classification models can 
very easily be interpreted as composite dispatching rules with predetermined 
weights. 
%Similarly for non-linear classification models, however, they are harder to 
%visualise since the features have to be projected on a kernel.
Looking at the features description in \cref{tbl:features} it is possible for 
the ordinal regression to `discover' the weights $\vec{w}$ in order for 
\cref{eq:CDR:feat} corresponding applying a \sdr~from \cref{sec:SDR}. }


\Cref{InRu11a,InRu15a,InRu15b} considered training data following the optimal 
trajectory. \Cref{InRu15a} improved the results be pursued also suboptimal 
trajectories based on SDRs from \cref{sec:SDR} as well as randomly dispatching 
operations. Finally, \cref{InRu15b} achieved the best results by sampling 
instead state-spaces from the induced preference model in an iterative fashion, 
each iteration improving the predecessive preference model.
