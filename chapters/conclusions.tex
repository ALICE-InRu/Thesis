The analysis-phase of \Alice\ is heavily dependent on having an expert 
policy one wants to mimic, i.e., knowing the \emph{optimal} solutions for the 
sake of imitation learning. 

Understandably, knowing the true optimum is an unreasonable claim in many 
situations, especially for high dimensional problem instances. 
Luckily, there seems to be the possibility to circumvent querying the expert 
altogether, and still have reasonable performance. 
By applying \emph{locally optimal learning to search} \citep{ChangKADL15} it is 
possible to use imitation learning even when the reference policy is poor. 
Although it's noted that the quality (w.r.t near-optimality) of reference 
policy is in accordance to its performance, as is to be expected.
