\frame{\frametitle{Performance measure}
     Performance of policy $\pi$ compared with its optimal makespan, found 
     using an expert policy, $\pi_{\star}$, is the following loss function: 
     $$\rho=\frac{C_{\max}^{\pi}-C_{\max}^{\pi_\star}}{C_{\max}^{\pi_\star}}\cdot
      100\%$$
    The goal is to minimise this discrepancy between \alert{predicted} value 
    and \alert{true} outcome.
