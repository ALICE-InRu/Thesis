Firstly, I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to my 
advisor, Prof. Tómas Philip Rúnarsson, who was abundantly patient and offered 
invaluable assistance and guidance. Deepest gratitude are also due to 
Gunnar Stefánsson and Michele Sébag, without whose assistance this study would 
not have been successful.

Special thanks to all my graduate and post-graduate friends \emph{Helgurnar og 
Tæknigarðsmennirnir} 
\begin{enumerate*}[label={{}}, after={{}}]
    \item Óli Palli for planting the seed that Apple is where it's at
    \item Anna Helga and Sigrún Helga for encourage me when my teaching had the 
    better of me
    \item Warsha [hans] Helga for inviting me to the most remarkable three day 
    Indian wedding in Fiji -- an absolute unforgettable experience
    \item Erla (an honorary Helga)
    \item Gunnar Geir for being my best pupil in Operations Research and for 
    not graduating before me
    \item Bjarki for getting me over to the dark side: 
    the \texttt{ggplot2} package on its own was worth the cross from 
    \textsc{matlab} to \textsc{r}, but \texttt{dplyr} sealed the deal
    \item Chris for believing in me that I could graduate from lower-case 
    \texttt{r} to capital \textsc{r} capabilities. You must admit, for a 
    non-statistician, my Shiny-app is pretty impressive!
\end{enumerate*}

I would like to convey thanks to the Research Fund of the University of 
Iceland for granting me a stipend during the first three years of my 
dissertation. 
In addition, I'd like to acknowledge my mother, Þóra Þorvarðardóttir, for 
providing financial means that gave me the opportunity to pursue a doctoral 
degree and more importantly the chance of travelling the world with excellent 
company. 

I owe special gratitude to my beloved family for continuous and unconditional 
support of all my undertakings, scholastic or otherwise. Not forgetting my best 
friends who have always been there for me, and probably won't ever read this, 
for they are not that kind of friends. 
I hope my dear friends Tinna, Salvör and Jóna will forgive me for being 
perpetually missing in action for \textsc{heit soja} activities, as I've been 
too preoccupied with trying to finish off my dissertation. 
Moreover, I'd like to thank Kristín, Sverrir and Gummi for our after-work 
special ``Föstudagur til fjár'' where we perpetual post-graduate students tried 
to make time to finish off our studies after punching out after 9-5pm.

Finally, I would like to thank my brother for proofreading my manuscript and 
teaching me the \emph{way of the showgirls}.
