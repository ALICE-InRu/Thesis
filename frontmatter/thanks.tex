\newthought{This thesis owes its existence} to the help, support, and inspiration of many. Firstly, I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Tómas Philip Rúnarsson, who was abundantly patient and offered invaluable assistance and guidance. Deepest gratitude are also due to \emph{other faculty members}, without whose assistance this study would not have been successful.

Special thanks to all my graduate friends, especially for putting up with my overwhelming yet fruitless attempts to opening them up to questionable cinema. 

I would also like to convey thanks to the Research Fund of the University of Iceland and my mother, Þóra Þorvarðardóttir, for providing financial means that gave me the opportunity to pursue a doctoral degree and travel the world. % Travel grants were awarded by the University of Iceland. 

I owe special gratitude to my beloved family for continuous and unconditional support of all my undertakings, scholastic or otherwise. Not forgetting my best friends who have always been there for me, and probably won't ever read this, for they are not that kind of friends. 

Finally, I would like to thank my brother for proofreading my manuscript and teaching me the \emph{way of the showgirls}.
